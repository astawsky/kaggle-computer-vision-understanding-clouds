To do list:

- Download segmentation models, open cv, and alubmentations libraries  ~~ DONE
- Create function that converts masks into Greyscale images ~~DONE
- Create Train-test split function
- 
- Data augmentation (optional but highly recommended)
- create a pipeline that goes through all the preprocessing
- Find or create Dice Coefficient metric


Development flow:

- run import_data.sh to download raw kaggle dataset
- start preprocessing
    - Read CSV and parse labels and images
    - Generate Greyscale masks of labels with the same size as the original image
    - 

- start prediction
    - 
    - scale encodings by 0.25
